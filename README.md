# Aerolab Coding Challenges

We've created a set of challenges for you to demonstrate your abilities as a developer. The challenge is on front-web technologies.

To get started, you should clone this repository and check out the challenges. Each challenge is self-contained in each folder, and you can do them in any order you want.

When you are finished doing this, you should send your repo to jobs@aerolab.co so we can take a look.

Good luck!
